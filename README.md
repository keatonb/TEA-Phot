# This is the [adapTive Elliptical Aperture PHOTometry (TEA-Phot)](https://bitbucket.org/DominicBowman/tea-phot) repository

**TEA-Phot** is a user-friendly pipeline to process ground-based photometry
 and extract light curves of stars for the purpose of variability and
 asteroseismology. **TEA-Phot** is coded in python and has no external
 software  dependencies such as IRAF, DS9 or Gaia, and utilises the
 flexible python module [SEP](https://sep.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.x/)
 at its core. The code is optimised for high-cadence ground-based
 photometry, such as that provided by the SHOC and STE instruments at
 the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za),
 but can be easily modified for different instruments at different
 observatories.

**TEA-Phot** is an open-source package, GNU-licensed, and any improvements
 provided by the users are well accepted. See disclaimer below and GNU
