# This is the [Adaptive Elliptical Aperture Photometry](https://bitbucket.org/DominicBowman/Adaptive elliptical aperture photometry/overview) repository

**AEAP** is a user-friendly pipeline to process ground-based photometry 
 and extract light curves of stars for the purpose of variability and 
 asteroseismology. **AEAP** is coded in python and has no external 
 software  dependencies such as IRAF, DS9 or Gaia, and utilises the 
 flexible python module **[SEP]**(https://sep.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.x/) 
 at its core. The code is optimised for high-cadence ground-based
 photometry, such as that provided by the SHOC and STE instruments at
 the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za),
 but can be easily modified for different instruments at different 
 observatories.
 
**AEAP** is an open-source package, GNU-licensed, and any improvements 
 provided by the users are well accepted. See disclaimer below and GNU 
 License in gpl-3.0.txt.
